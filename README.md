Intro to API code for assignment

This assignment is the code for the slides found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V3svGYuDul_irvi_uRPr69qpmHjSNVOoLsNcm6ywoc4/edit?usp=sharing

The code is meant to serve as a introduction to what is possible with APIs for those who have not yet learned much about them.
However, there is no included API key for safety so in order to use with a public API, you must create an API key and follow the specific API instructions.



## Dependencies

This code requires Axios which can be installed with node by running: npm install axios

This code is also designed as an example for possible API requests and does not connect to a specific API because I don't want a personal API key available for use.
